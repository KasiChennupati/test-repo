# Data Science and Machine Learning

## PreRequisites

- Python Programming Experience
- Linear-Algebra (Matrix Operations, SVD decomposition)
- Probability (Distributions, Random variables, Bayes' rules)

### Supervised Machine Learning
 SML is the most common type of machine learning

Steps:
1. We collect a dataset of labelled training examples.
1. we train a model to output accurate predictions on this dataset.
1. when the model sees new, similar data, it will be accurate.
