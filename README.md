## Dual number: 
The dual number is a form of number that is represented as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a+ \epsilon b ">
Where the a is the real number and the b is the dual number 
The fomat is kind of like a complex number notation but here instead of having the Epsilon
